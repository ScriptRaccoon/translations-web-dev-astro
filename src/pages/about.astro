	<section class="about">
		<p>
			Here you find translations from English to German of terms
			which are commonly used in web development. Currently
			there are {numberOfTranslations} of them (of which {
				numberOfMissingTranslations
			} are missing).
		</p>
		<p>
			Many native German speakers, including myself, just use
			English words, even when German words are available
			("checkbox" = "Kontrollk√§stchen"), or mix them up with
			German words ("Defaultwert").
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to differentiate the quality of the translations,
			each translation is rated with one of the following four
			options:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<img src="checked.png" alt="checked" />&nbsp; The
				translation is available, verified and used very often
				by German speakers.
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="tick.png" alt="tick" />&nbsp; The
				translation is available and verified, but not used
				that much by German speakers. Usually they prefer the
				English word here, i.e. they speak <i>Denglisch</i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="invention.png" alt="tick" />&nbsp; I guessed
				or worked out a translation here. The translation is
				not official by any means. But if you like my
				translation, let's use it more often!
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="nothing.png" alt="nothing" />&nbsp; The
				translation is missing, unfortunately. Let me know if
				you have any ideas.
			</li>
		</ol>
