		<p>
			Here you find translations from English to German of terms
			which are commonly used in web development. Currently
			there are {numberOfTranslations} of them (of which {
				numberOfMissingTranslations
			} are missing).
		</p>
		<p>
			Many native German speakers, including myself, just use
			English words, even when German words are available
			("checkbox" = "Kontrollk√§stchen"), or mix them up with
			German words ("Defaultwert").
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, in many cases no official translation seems
			to be available. Some of the translations here merely
			represent my best guesses.
		</p>
