# Translations of web development terms

https://translations-web-dev.netlify.app/

Here you find translations (English to German) of terms which are commonly used in web development.

The file with all translations is [here](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/translations-web-dev-astro/blob/main/src/data/translations.ts). I am happy about every contribution to this list.
